# DevHub
A platform for developers to showcase their projects.

## The Idea ðŸ’¡

We've all visited Dribbble atleast once, right ? You know, the cool place where designers go to showcase their projects and their work. Pretty cool, right ? So why not make such a website for the developers ? And hence, DevHub was born. Although there are websites like [Codepen](https://codepen.io/), I didn't really feel that it resembled what Dribbble is to designers. This is my first MERN stack project and I hope you like it.

## Want to contribute?

- If you find a problem with the website or you have an idea, please report it in the web repository.

- If you want to contribute to this repo, please first of all Fork the repo and then submit your _pull requests_

Okay so now that you've forked & cloned the repo, let's take a look at the contents.
The frontend or React part of the website lies in the `client` folder while the other files and folder in the root belong to the backend.
Now, let's install the dependencies. Go to the repo directory.

```
# Installing backend dependencies
yarn install

# Installing frontend dependencies
cd client
yarn install
```

**Feel free to use `npm install` instead of `yarn install` if that's what you prefer**

We're done with installing the dependencies, woohoo ! Now, let's set up some environment variables.

```
# Assuming you're in the root folder and not client folder
cd config
touch default.json
```

Okay, so what is this `default.json` file you ask ? We'll be using this to store our sensitive information like MongoDB URI, API key and more.
**This is how your `default.json` file should look like :**

```
{
  "MONGO_URI": "",
  "JWT_SECRET": "",
  "GITHUB_API_CLIENT_ID": "",
  "GITHUB_API_CLIENT_SECRET": "",
  "CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME": "",
  "CLOUDINARY_API_KEY": "",
  "CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET": ""
}
```

Make sure you enter your own stuff with the quotes, like this:
`"JWT_SECRET": "anything",`

And we're done setting up DevHub, yay !

## Running on Your Machine

```
npm run dev
```

**Make sure you run this command in the root directory and not the client directory**
This will run both the Express backend server and the React server. It's that easy.
